    <h1>Demo of on-demand images</h1>

    <p>The image below was generated by requesting "public/static/image/sitepoint_logo-320.png", which did not exist beforehand. It was generated from "assets/image/sitepoint_logo.png". Try changing its width in dev tools to one of the following to generate a new one, or to any other width to generate an error. You can alter the allowed widths in "Standard/Controllers/ImageController", and you can change the path from which the source is read and to which the processed image is saved in "app/config.php".</p>

    <p><img src="/static/image/sitepoint_logo-320.png"
         alt="SitePoint Logo Resized"></p>

    <p>Feel free to delete "public/static/image/sitepoint_logo-320.png" and refresh this page - it will re-appear.</p>

    <p>Adding more images is just a matter of adding extra source images into "assets/image" and using them with a width suffix. Note that the widths are limited to prevent an image-processing attack (someone could request a billion sizes if it weren't limited).</p>
